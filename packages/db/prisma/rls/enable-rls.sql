-- Row-Level Security policies.

-- Prisma Migrate does NOT generate these. After every `prisma migrate dev` that
-- adds a tenant table, append this file's contents (or the new table's stanza)
-- to the generated migration.sql before committing. `pnpm db:rls:check` fails
-- CI if a tenant table ships without a policy.
--
-- Session variables, set per transaction by packages/db/src/tenant.ts:
--   app.current_org    uuid    the tenant
--   app.branch_scope   uuid[]  branches this request may touch
--   app.current_user   uuid    the acting user
--   app.impersonator   uuid    set when a platform admin is inside a tenant
--
-- All four are read with `current_setting(..., true)` — the `true` means
-- "return NULL if unset" instead of raising. Unset therefore matches NO rows:
-- the policies fail closed.

-- Org-scoped tables: one predicate, applied to both read and write.
--
-- Deliberately ENABLE, not FORCE.
--   ENABLE -> policies apply to everyone EXCEPT the table owner.
--   FORCE  -> policies apply to the owner as well.
--
-- FORCE sounds safer and is the wrong choice here. The owner role exists
-- precisely to run migrations, seeds and support tooling, none of which have a
-- tenant context; under FORCE every one of them fails. Isolation is guaranteed
-- instead by the role split: the application connects as rcln_app, which owns
-- nothing and has NOBYPASSRLS, so policies always apply to it.
--
-- The risk FORCE was covering — someone pointing DATABASE_URL at the owner —
-- is handled by assertRlsActive() in src/client.ts, which refuses to boot the
-- app on an owner connection. That fails loudly at startup instead of silently
-- at query time.

-- Deliberately NOT tenant-scoped, with the reason recorded.
--
--   organizations       resolved by hostname BEFORE a tenant context exists
--   organization_domains the host -> tenant lookup itself. Putting this under
--                        tenant_isolation is circular: the query that
--                        establishes app.current_org cannot require
--                        app.current_org to already be set. Reads are by exact
--                        domain only, which leaks nothing an attacker cannot
--                        already learn by resolving DNS.
--   users              global identity; one login spans organizations
--   sessions           looked up by refresh-token hash pre-context
--   auth_tokens        OTP verification happens pre-context
--   user_identities    SSO callback happens pre-context
--   roles              system roles have organization_id NULL by design
--   permissions        static catalogue
--   role_permissions   joins two non-tenant tables
--   plans / plan_*     platform-wide product catalogue
--   setting_*          scoped by (scope_type, scope_id), not organization_id
--   branch_*           child of branches; reached only via a scoped parent
--
-- Access to these is gated in the application layer. `check-rls.ts` holds the
-- same list, so adding a table without a policy fails CI until it is either
-- given one or consciously added to the exemption list.
